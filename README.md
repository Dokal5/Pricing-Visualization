**Pricing and Price Sensitivity Analysis Tool**
This Pricing and Price Sensitivity Analysis Tool helps users analyze price sensitivity, survey data, and pricing decisions for a product or service. It allows users to define their market, input costs, analyze survey data using the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM), and assess profitability through demand and profit curves. Users can also input a price point to calculate the break-even quantity and develop strategic insights.

**Features**
Define the market segment and its population size.
Input fixed and variable costs for accurate cost analysis.
Analyze survey data using the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM).
Calculate the Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC) and Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME).
Visualize demand and profit curves, including confidence intervals for PMC and PME.
Compare pricing with competitor benchmarks.
Determine the break-even quantity based on a user-defined price point.
Reflect on pricing strategies with prompts for developing bundles and promotional strategies.

**Step-by-Step Guide**
Step 1: Define Your Market
Segment Name: Input the name of the segment you want to analyze (e.g., "Main Segment").
Population Size: Enter the total addressable market size for your segment. This is the number of potential customers in your target market.

Step 2: Define Costs
Variable Cost per Product/Service (€): Adjust this slider to input the cost associated with producing or delivering one unit of your product or service.
Fixed Cost (€): Adjust this slider to input costs that do not vary with the number of units sold (e.g., rent, salaries).

Step 3: Input PSM Survey Data
Sample Size: Enter the number of respondents from your survey.
Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC): Enter the price at which respondents perceive the product as being too cheap.
Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME): Enter the price at which respondents perceive the product as being too expensive.
Click the Expander titled "What is the Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM)?" for more information about this method and how it guides pricing decisions.

Step 4: Input Competitors' Pricing
Number of Competitors: Select the number of competitors you want to benchmark against (up to 5).
For each competitor, enter:
Brand: The name of the competitor.
Product Specification: A brief description of the competitor’s product.
Price: The price at which the competitor sells their product.

Step 5: Set Your Price and Calculate Break-Even Quantity
Enter Your Price Setting (€): Input the price point you want to set for your product.
The app will automatically calculate the Break-Even Quantity, which is the number of units you need to sell at this price to cover all fixed and variable costs.
Click the Expander titled "How is the Break-Even Quantity calculated?" for an explanation of the formula used.

Step 6: Visualize Demand and Profit Curves
The app will display a graph with:
Demand Curve: Showing the expected quantity sold at different prices.
Profit Curve: Displaying the profitability at various price points.
Optimal Price: Highlighted in red, indicating the price point with the highest profit.
Confidence Intervals: Shaded regions around PMC and PME for better decision-making.
Competitor Prices: Displayed as points on the demand curve for easy comparison.
Your Price: Shown as a blue line with an annotation for the break-even quantity.

Reflection and Analysis
After setting your price, the app will prompt you with questions to help refine your strategy:
Pricing Bundles or Tier Pricing: Think about whether you can create value through different pricing tiers or bundles to capture more market segments.
Promotion/Communication and Channel Strategy: Plan how you will reach your target customers and communicate the value of your product to meet the break-even quantity.
These questions are designed to guide you towards a comprehensive pricing strategy that aligns with your business goals.
